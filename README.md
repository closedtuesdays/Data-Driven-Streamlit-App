<p> This repo follows Snowflake's <a href="https://learn.snowflake.com/en/courses/uni-ess-dabw">Hands On Badge 2: Data Application Builders Workshop</a>. The Streamlit web app I built leverages a Snowflake connection to either <code>select</code> or <code>update</code> rows in a Snowflake table. It also calls USDA's FoodData Central API to get fruit data. The workshop was really great for exposure to:</br>
<li>basic Rest API call development exposure, </li>
<li> Python web development using Streamlit modules, </li>
<li>and general JSON object model navigation.</li>
</br>
